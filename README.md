# Rollev

**Rollev** is a resource management game/platform that lets you **command your entire AI workforce** from a single, intuitive spatial interface.

Instead of managing AI agents one by one through isolated prompts, Rollev allows you to visualize, coordinate, and control multiple AI agents simultaneously — like managing units in a strategy game.

## 🎮 What is Rollev?

Rollev transforms AI coordination into a spatial strategy experience.

Think of it as:
- 🧠 AI workforce management  
- 🎯 Real-time strategy (RTS) style control  
- 📊 Resource optimization engine  
- 🔗 Visual workflow orchestration  

You don’t just prompt AI — you command it.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🗺 Spatial Interface
Control all your AI agents from a unified visual canvas. Select, group, and assign objectives visually.

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Control
Manage dozens or hundreds of AI agents simultaneously.

### 📊 Resource Management
Monitor token usage, API costs, task progress, and system performance in real time.

### 🔄 Workflow Orchestration
Link agents together to create automated pipelines and multi-step task flows.

### 🧩 Visual Task Assignment
Assign objectives and configure behaviors without writing complex code.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Create or deploy AI agents  
2. Assign objectives via the spatial interface  
3. Connect agents into workflows  
4. Monitor execution and resource usage  
5. Optimize your AI workforce dynamically

## 🎯 Vision

Rollev aims to redefine how humans interact with AI systems.

Instead of:
> One human → One prompt → One response  

We move toward:
> One human → Many AI agents → Coordinated execution  

Rollev makes AI feel like a controllable system — not just a chat interface.
